# Antibacklash project

- 3DModels -> 3D prints for the test rig
- antibacklashlib/antibacklashsys -> CDPStudio code
- Python -> all python scrips and .csv-files
    - data -> all .csv and .txt files from scripts, megalog2.csv and results_from_megalog2.txt the most recent. A lot of 'false positives' sometimes not correctly filtered out.
    - main.py -> the one to use
